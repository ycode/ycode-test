# Ycode Airtable

Hi! Are you ready to join our team working on an innovative and exciting project? We are looking for a full-stack developer.

For the test assignment, we would like you to create a page which connects to Airtable and renders its data in a table format. It should also
include a form which on submission, data will be posted back to Airtable and appear in your table.

We have provided a base HTML layout for your table and form.

Use small commits and descriptive commit messages while working on the assignment. One commit solving one issue.

There are a few things you should take into consideration:
- The website should be able to withstand thousands of visitors at one time.
- The blue colour used on the H1 should be swapped out for #3C8999.
- Each field submitted via the form should be required except for photo.
- Photo uploads should be of type JPG only and be no bigger than 100MB.

We have also created an example Airtable dataset for you to use. We require you to copy this dataset to your own Airtable
account by following these instructions:
1. Navigate to the example dataset by following the link "https://airtable.com/shrsffH1u5qtGmviu/tblazX8u4wWhOJQnT".
2. In the top right, you should see and click a button that says "Use this data".
3. Create or use an existing Airtable account to select a workspace and a base of "Create a new base....".
4. This data should now be copied into your own Airtable account.
5. You will also have to generate an Airtable API key by visiting "https://airtable.com/account".
6. After you have copied the example dataset and generated an API key, all other credentials can be found on "https://airtable.com/api".
